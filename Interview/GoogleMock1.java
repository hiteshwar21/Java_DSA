    // Never give up
    // Come up with all the approach
    // If nothing works, atleast complete brute force approach.
    // divide a complex questions into smaller easier to implement parts
    // if you are stuck, you may ask for hints/ look for hints from interviewer
    // If corner cases, create a separate method (makes your life easier) (Separation of Concerns). TDD
    // Code fast. Back yourself but only after intensive practice.
    // If interviewer insists in a single direction again & again, take his direction. Finding solution is not the purpose of interview, he is trying to check certain something.
    // STRING IS FUCKING IMMUTABLE. DONâ€™T USE IT.
    // StringBuilder/ StringBuffer Syntax (Conversion to and fro)
    // Write loop properly, Use while and for
    // Can use Streams/Lambda (Extra marks, baby!)
    // %x, *x, /x -> MC! Use kar
    // Special utils(Date.now(), Math.MAX_VALUE etc)
