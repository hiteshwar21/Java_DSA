Imagine you have a database with the following tables: Employees, Department and EmployeeRelations. The Employees table has the following columns: EmployeeID, deptId, Name, and Salary. The EmployeeRelations table has two columns: ManagerID and EmployeeID, where ManagerID represents the manager of the employee with EmployeeID. Write an SQL query to find the highest-paid employee in each department, including their manager's name.

Select E1.EmployeeId, (E2.ManagerId) as managerId
from Employee E1
inner join Employee E2 where E1.EmployeeId = E2.EmployeeId

Department Table - DepId, DepName
